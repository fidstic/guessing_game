This game is called goFish. 

It uses an array with the variable name of fly. Var fly consists of four 
different strings. The strings in this instance are flies, or fishing lure.

The user is prompted to input one fly to use to go fishing which is stored in 
the variable called guess. 

The variable guess is then compared against a variable named "answer" which is arandomly chosen integer between 0-3 corresponding to the position of a string 
within the variable array fly. 

The answer and the guess are run through a series of conditional statements. If
the answer and guess match, the guess is then matched with the corresponding 
string placement in the array. This produces a unique message regarding what 
type of fish the user caught. 

If the user types something other than a string in the array the output defaults to a default message.
